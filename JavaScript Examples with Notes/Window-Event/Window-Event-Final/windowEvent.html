<!-- The onload event occurs when an object has been loaded.

    The onload event is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.). 

    It is used with <body>, <frame>, <iframe>, <img>, <input type="image">, <link>, <script>, <style> elements-->

<!-- The onbeforeunload event occurs when the document is about to be       unloaded. 
    This event allows you to display a message in a confirmation dialog box to inform the user whether he/she wants to stay or leave the current page.
    
    The default message that appears in the confirmation box, is different in different browsers. However, the standard message is something like "Are you sure you want to leave this page?". This message cannot be removed.

    However, you can write a custom message together with the default message and use the returnValue property to create a custom message but this only works in Internet Explorer.

    The onbeforeunload event is mostly used with <body> element-->

<!-- The onresize event occurs when the browser window has been resized.The onresize event is mostly used with <body> element-->
